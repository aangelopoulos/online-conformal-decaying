# Online Conformal Prediction with Decaying Step Sizes
Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, Rina F. Barber, Stephen Bates

This is a lightweight codebase used to reproduce the experiments in our paper.
To run it, you will need the following dependencies
```
jupyter
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas
gdown
```

There are two relevant notebooks: `elec2.ipynb` and `imagenet-smallest-sets.ipynb`, which implement the according experiments in our paper.

Our main method is implemented as the only function in `core.py`.
